# My-Journey-in-Machine-Learning-

This repository serves as a centralized location where I will share my findings and showcase my progress as I continue to learn and grow in machine learning.

Within this repository, you will find a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts, each of which represents a different mini project that I have worked on. These projects cover a wide range of topics within machine learning, including data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, and more.

Each project includes detailed documentation, explaining the purpose and methodology behind the analysis, as well as any insights and conclusions that I have drawn from the data. Additionally, I have included any relevant datasets and resources that I have used in each project, allowing to replicate and build upon my work.
